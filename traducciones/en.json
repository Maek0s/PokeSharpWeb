    "faq5P1": "The idea was created a year before its development, by someone other than the creator, it was Izan, my classmate, who tried to create something using the terminal with Java. I decided to ask to join his project, and I worked on the interfaces, but ultimately it couldn't be completed due to a lack of knowledge and time. A year later, we had to make an individual project, so I asked him if I could continue starting from scratch in a different way. I got permission, and I changed the name from PokeJava to PokeSharp since the previous plan was to make it in Java... and here we are.",
    "faq6": "6. Where does the name PokeSharp come from?",
